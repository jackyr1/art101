                <p>My name is Jacky, I am a first year majoring in AGPM. I like listening to music while going on walks in the forest with friends.
                 My partner's name is Maya! She likes the color green a lot, you can see it a lot in her outfits and room (which
                 is really aesthetic). 
                 She's a year older than me, but is also a first year because she took a gap year. I met her through my
                 friend and we've played Minecraft together a lot and gone on many late night walks. We both LOVE cats and each have one that is a Siamese/Tabby
                 breed mix. She also makes really cool paintings.</p>
