			<h3>Lab 2 - My First HTML</h3>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge is to create a webpage with the heading Hello World, aswell as customizing it to our desire through CSS and HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some of the problems we had was centering an image we imported onto the hello world. We resolved the issue by asking wesbot. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall I think the lab went quite well. There was a lot of time spent browsing all the code to really understand how it works
						and connects between the HTML and the CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We accomplished the lab and was able to create a pretty and functioning site. </p>
					<ul class="link">
					<a href="helloworld.html">Hello World</a>
